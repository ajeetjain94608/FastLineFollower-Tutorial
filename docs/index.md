# Fast Line Follower Robot: Complete Tutorial

Welcome to the ultimate guide for building, wiring, and programming a fast line follower robot using the ESP32 WROOM! This blog will walk you through every step, from hardware to code, with live code links and troubleshooting tips.

---

## 🚦 What You'll Learn
- How to wire and configure each hardware component
- How to test every part individually
- How to run the full robot code
- How to debug and expand your project

---

## 🛠️ Hardware List
- ESP32 WROOM (38-pin)
- Motor driver (dual H-bridge)
- 2x DC motors
- 2x Encoders
- 16:1 Analog MUX (e.g., CD74HC4067)
- 16 IR sensors (or as needed)
- OLED display (I2C, SSD1306)
- 4 push buttons
- Buzzer
- Wires, breadboard, power supply

---

## 📐 Pinout Table
See [hardware/pinout_tables.md](../hardware/pinout_tables.md) for a full table of all ESP32 pin assignments.

---

## 🔌 Wiring Diagrams
Add your Fritzing or hand-drawn diagrams in [hardware/wiring_diagrams/](../hardware/wiring_diagrams/).

---

## 🧪 Component Testing
Test each part before full assembly! See [docs/component_testing.md](component_testing.md) for how to use:
- `test_motor.ino`
- `test_encoder.ino`
- `test_oled.ino`
- `test_buttons.ino`
- `test_buzzer.ino`
- `test_mux.ino`
- `test_all_in_one.ino` (menu-driven)

---

## 🚗 Main Robot Code
Once all tests pass, upload `fastlinefollower/fastlinefollower.ino` for full operation.

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting
See [docs/troubleshooting.md](troubleshooting.md) for common issues and solutions.
